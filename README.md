                                    8. Marks in writing

The analysis has been made upon some phases - 1. Data visulaization
                                              2. Pre-processing
                                              3. EDA (Exploratory Data analysis)
                                              4. Conclusion
                                              
                                              
 The data is purely leakage free and that can be seen in the visualization and pre-processing in the notebook.
 
 The data clearly is an ideal data and that can be predicted via philosophically.
 
 Hope you like this analysis.  :)
